# A Standard Github Page

## What I hope to gain from this
The main aim of using the github pages feature is to give me the ability to try out things I've never used before such as CSS grid. Hopefully once I have a decent amount of time to devote to this I can start to become more acquainted with the more complex aspects of front end dev.
